			 <div class="intro"><p>Every generation has the chance to shape the world, and I always hold the belief that changes can happen from my hands. As a graduate student from XJTLU, and an incoming student of Geneva University, I’m going to conduct further study on sustainability development of our world. The good time I spent together with all my team members in this project has become an unforgettable period during my research journey on the global climate change topic. By leading the team, studying the most up-to-date academic articles, analyzing various data and designing the global governance model over and over again, I made what thought to be difficult comes into reality. </p></div>

			 <div class="intro"><p>My original intention to do this project is my dream to live in a better world from my childhood. Climate change is a serious problem that may destroy the whole world, and our team aim to find a wise method to control climate change and even other serious problems in this world. My major is telecommunication engineering which is not very relative to this topic, but I will use the mathematical analyse to find the best technology by analyzing different factors. To reach the final goal, I will also create a framework and evaluate it mathematically with my group members. I believe the strong dream can make us accomplish our all goals.</p></div>

			 <div class="intro"><p>In this global challenge competition, our group focuses on the global climate change problem. My main task is to research the existing general global framework on climate changes. From my study, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is still the most authoritative framework to institute the related mechanisms and supervise the situation of the carbon emission reduction in the involved countries. I should also read the synthesis reports of IPCC which have been published in recent years to make our idea inspired. In addition, I learn the operation of the software SPSS to provide the statistics support for our collected data and benefit the model constructing process. </p></div>

			 <div class="intro"><p>My name is Zhao Yalan. I have been an undergraduate in XJTLU and studied Financial Mathematics since 2015. My interests include math, programming, economics and finance. I joined this project in May, 2017. I have collaborated with my groupmates to figure out the causes and effects of climate change. Also we have understood the potential problems of the today’s global governance model whose main tool to tackle climate change is United Nations.  And we are going to design a new governance model taking into factors including economics, politics and ecology to help society mitigate and adapt global warming more effectively and efficiently. In particular, I will make contributions to my group in the area of economics and mathematics.</p></div>

			 <div class="intro"><p>Global Climate Change has been the most severe problem worldwide and it is everyone’s responsibility to resolve to handle this problem which may affect directly the living environment and future of our human beings.   The purpose of our project is to establish a new practical framework under which the problem of global warming can be effectively handled through analyzing the current authoritative mechanism of United Nations.  My name is Xu Yi and I am a year 1 student from XJTLU majoring in Economics and Finance.  During the project progress, I am required to read numbers of articles concerning global actions of climate mitigation and the establishment of  governance models from authoritative publications such as <Nature> before starting to writing our essays to clarify our framework.</p></div>
